# SwiftUIStopwatch
A SwiftUI implementation of the stopwatch feature in Apple's Clock app on iOS.

A stopwatch is a simple, single screen app, yet has state which can easily get out of sync. This makes it a good candidate for developing in SwiftUI; a declarative UI framework which encourages correct state management through it's own design.
